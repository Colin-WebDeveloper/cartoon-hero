					<p>Swept up in the era's passion for piracy, Monkey D. Luffy sets out to become a pirate...but not just any pirate. At a young age, he sets the goal to become King of the Pirates! Helping him in this quest is the power of the Gum-Gum Devil Fruit he accidentally ingests as a child. The fruit instantly transformed him into a rubber person!</p>
